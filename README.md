📁 File Information

Here’s what’s included in the dataset:

images/

📂 Images of different breeds are stored in separate folders.

annotations/

📝 Bounding box annotations for each image.

file_list.mat

🗂️ List of all files in the dataset.

train_list.mat

🏋️ List and labels for all training images.

test_list.mat

🧪 List and labels for all test images.

📊 Training Splits

For testing with fewer than 100 images per class:

The first n indices for each class in train_list.mat were used, where n represents the number of training images per class.

🔍 Feature Information

Files:

train_data.mat & test_data.mat

Contains the feature matrix after applying the histogram intersection kernel.


train_fg_data.mat & test_fg_data.mat

Contains the feature matrix before applying the histogram intersection kernel.

train_info.mat & test_info.mat

Contains labels and IDs corresponding to images in the feature matrix.
